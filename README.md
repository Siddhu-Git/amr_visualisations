# amr_visualisations
Simple python animated examples for the planning segment of the Autonomous Mobile Robots lecture slides.


## Basic installation and requirements
Clone the repo, install dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/amr_visualisations.git
cd amr_visualisations
pip install -r requirements
``` 

## Configuration space examples

These are some basic examples of generating configuration spaces and illustrating them.

First, enter the directory `cd config_space`

### 3D (x,y,&theta;) robot configuration space
This simple script uses a basic polygon collision checking library and sampling to show the configuration space for a 2D robot.
Obstacles are generated by sampling random points and creating a convex hull.

A basic example can be generated with:
```
python config_space_plot.py
```

Help for the flags etc. are available with:
```
python config_space_plot.py -h
```

Some things you might like to change include:
 - The robot footprint is defined with a csv file ([example](config_space/robots/bar_robot.csv)) and set with the `--robot-footprint` flag
 - You can change the sampling density with the `-nx` flag
 - Generate the 3D rotation animation with the `--animation` flag 

### Robot arm configuration space
This script shows the configuration space for a basic multi-jointed robot arm.
A basic example can be generated with:
```
python arm_config_space.py
```

Again, basic help can be found with
```
python arm_config_space.py -h
```

The obstacles and robot are currently hardcoded, but the code should work for different obstacle and robot link lengths and can be modified in the code to see how the config space changes.
(This could be improved if useful?)

### Potential field example
```
python potential_field.py
```

## Poincar√© example
```
cd poincare_example
python poincare_1d.py
```
